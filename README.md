# WordFinder Console Application

The **WordFinder Console Application** is designed to solve the following problem:

Given a character matrix and a large stream of words, your task is to create a class that searches the matrix for the words from the word stream. Words may appear **horizontally** (from left to right) or **vertically** (from top to bottom). 

For example, if the word stream contains four words and the matrix includes only three of those words ("chill", "cold", and "wind"), the application will identify the matches accordingly.

## Features

The console application presents a menu with the following options:

1. **Show a working example**
2. **Show an example with a null matrix provided**
3. **Show an example with a matrix that has words of different lengths**
4. **Exit the application**

Feel free to explore the application and see how it handles various scenarios!
